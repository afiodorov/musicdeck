Generating anki flashcards for learning musical theory.

I am writing this in rust for the lolz.

Currently I used this for generating major scales:

```.bash
> cargo run > /tmp/music.txt

# outputs:
notes in A major; A B C# D E F# G#
notes in A# major; A# C D D# F G A
notes in B major; B C# D# E F# G# A#
notes in C major; C D E F G A B
notes in C# major; C# D# F F# G# A# C
notes in D major; D E F# G A B C#
notes in D# major; D# F G G# A# C D
notes in E major; E F# G# A B C# D#
notes in F major; F G A A# C D E
notes in F# major; F# G# A# B C# D# F
notes in G major; G A B C D E F#
notes in G# major; G# A# C C# D# F G
```
